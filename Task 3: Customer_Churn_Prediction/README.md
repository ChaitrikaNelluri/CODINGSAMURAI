# Customer Churn Prediction 🔄

A machine learning project to predict customer churn using Random Forest and Logistic Regression models.

## 📋 Project Overview

Customer churn prediction is crucial for businesses to identify customers who are likely to discontinue their services. This project analyzes customer data and builds predictive models to identify patterns associated with customer churn, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze customer behavior and identify factors contributing to churn
- Build and compare multiple machine learning models for churn prediction
- Visualize key insights from the data
- Achieve high prediction accuracy for business decision-making

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains customer information including:
- **Customer Demographics**: Gender, Senior Citizen status
- **Service Information**: Internet Service, Contract type, Payment method
- **Usage Metrics**: Tenure, Monthly Charges, Total Charges
- **Target Variable**: Churn (Yes/No)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` - Data manipulation and analysis
  - `numpy` - Numerical computations
  - `matplotlib` - Data visualization
  - `seaborn` - Statistical data visualization
  - `scikit-learn` - Machine learning models and evaluation

## 📁 Project Structure

```
├── Churn_Prediction_Final.ipynb    # Main Jupyter notebook
├── churn_data.csv                   # Dataset (not included in repo)
└── README.md                        # Project documentation
```

## 🔍 Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Handled missing values
- Converted data types (TotalCharges to numeric)
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Churn Distribution**: Analyzed the balance of churned vs retained customers
- **Gender Analysis**: Examined churn rates across genders
- **Contract Type**: Identified churn patterns based on contract duration
- **Internet Service**: Analyzed impact of internet service type on churn
- **Monthly Charges**: Visualized distribution of charges
- **Tenure Analysis**: Explored relationship between customer tenure and churn

### 3. Data Visualization
- Count plots for categorical variables
- Histograms for continuous variables
- Box plots for tenure analysis
- Correlation heatmap for numeric features
- Confusion matrix visualization
- Feature importance charts

### 4. Model Building

#### Random Forest Classifier
- Ensemble learning method using multiple decision trees
- Trained on preprocessed data with hyperparameter tuning

#### Logistic Regression
- Binary classification algorithm
- Baseline model for comparison

### 5. Model Evaluation
- **Accuracy Score**: Overall prediction accuracy
- **Classification Report**: Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- **Confusion Matrix**: True/False Positives and Negatives
- **Feature Importance**: Identified key predictors of churn

## 📈 Results

The models were evaluated and compared based on:
- Prediction accuracy
- Precision and recall metrics
- Feature importance rankings
- Confusion matrix analysis
