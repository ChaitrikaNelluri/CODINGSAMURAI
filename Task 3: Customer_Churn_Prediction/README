Customer Churn Prediction 🔄
A machine learning project to predict customer churn using Random Forest and Logistic Regression models.
📋 Project Overview
Customer churn prediction is crucial for businesses to identify customers who are likely to discontinue their services. This project analyzes customer data and builds predictive models to identify patterns associated with customer churn, enabling proactive retention strategies.
🎯 Objectives

Analyze customer behavior and identify factors contributing to churn
Build and compare multiple machine learning models for churn prediction
Visualize key insights from the data
Achieve high prediction accuracy for business decision-making

📊 Dataset
The dataset contains customer information including:

Customer Demographics: Gender, Senior Citizen status
Service Information: Internet Service, Contract type, Payment method
Usage Metrics: Tenure, Monthly Charges, Total Charges
Target Variable: Churn (Yes/No)

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x
Libraries:

pandas - Data manipulation and analysis
numpy - Numerical computations
matplotlib - Data visualization
seaborn - Statistical data visualization
scikit-learn - Machine learning models and evaluation



📁 Project Structure
├── Churn_Prediction_Final.ipynb    # Main Jupyter notebook
├── churn_data.csv                   # Dataset (not included in repo)
└── README.md                        # Project documentation
🔍 Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing

Loaded and explored the dataset
Handled missing values
Converted data types (TotalCharges to numeric)
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)

2. Exploratory Data Analysis

Churn Distribution: Analyzed the balance of churned vs retained customers
Gender Analysis: Examined churn rates across genders
Contract Type: Identified churn patterns based on contract duration
Internet Service: Analyzed impact of internet service type on churn
Monthly Charges: Visualized distribution of charges
Tenure Analysis: Explored relationship between customer tenure and churn

3. Data Visualization

Count plots for categorical variables
Histograms for continuous variables
Box plots for tenure analysis
Correlation heatmap for numeric features
Confusion matrix visualization
Feature importance charts

4. Model Building
Random Forest Classifier

Ensemble learning method using multiple decision trees
Trained on preprocessed data with hyperparameter tuning

Logistic Regression

Binary classification algorithm
Baseline model for comparison

5. Model Evaluation

Accuracy Score: Overall prediction accuracy
Classification Report: Precision, Recall, F1-Score
Confusion Matrix: True/False Positives and Negatives
Feature Importance: Identified key predictors of churn

📈 Results
The models were evaluated and compared based on:

Prediction accuracy
